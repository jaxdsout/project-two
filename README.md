**QWIKLOK**
A timekeeping application made for SME's, contractors and tradesmen.

There is an untapped market of small-medium sized contractors who use simple accounting software like Quickbooks, but who do not use software for time-keeping or project management.

If a contractor wanted to know how many hours each of his employees worked at different projects (for billing and for payroll), this would often mean digging through hand written notes or text messages and then adding up the hours on a spreadsheet. This app makes that information readily available to the contractor, which enables them to: 
- quickly do employee payroll
- properly bill their general contractor/customer
- monitor their man-hours on a particular project
